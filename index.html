            <h1><span class="naruto">NARUTO</span></h1>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki, a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja, lives in Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf village.
                Moments prior to his birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure
                and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the 4th
                Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto. Shunned because of
                the presence of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village. He strives to
                become the Hokage of Konohagakure, and he meets many friends and foes along the way. [Written by MAL
